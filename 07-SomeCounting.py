Exercise 7: Some Counting

"""

#For Loop1, I instead used the while loop for it, since I'm more used to using that.
Loop1=0
while Loop1 < 50: #While Loop1 is lesser than 50, it'll keep adding 1.
    print(Loop1) 
    Loop1 += 1
    #It will loop until the number reaches 50.

#Same for Loop2, I used a while loop, and Loop2 starts its value with 50.    
Loop2=50
while Loop2 > 0: #While Loop2(50) is lesser than 0, it'll subtract 50 by 1 until it reaches 0.
    print(Loop2)
    Loop2 -= 1
#Then decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

#For Loop3, the starting value is 30.
Loop3=30
while Loop3 < 51: #While Loop3 is lesser than 51, it'll keep adding 1 until it reaches 50.
      print(Loop3)
      Loop3 += 1
#It then loops and adds 1 until it reaches 50     

#For Loop4, to decrease it by 2 until it reaches 10. The variable starts with 50.
Loop4=50
while Loop4 > 8: #While Loop4 is greater than 10, it'll subtract by 2 until it reaches 10.
      print(Loop4)
      Loop4 -= 2
#It then decreases the value of 50 by 2 until it reaches 10.

#For Loop5, to increase the number of 100 to 200 in the increments of 5.        
Loop5=100 #We have to define Loop5's starting value which is 100.
while Loop5 < 205: #While Loop5 is lower than 205, it'll keep adding by 5 until it reaches 200.
    print(Loop5)
    Loop5 += 5
